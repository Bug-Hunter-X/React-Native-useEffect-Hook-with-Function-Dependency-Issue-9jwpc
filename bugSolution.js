To solve this, avoid directly including the function in the dependency array. Instead, use a value derived from the function or its dependencies:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const myFunction = () => {
    // Some logic
    console.log('My function called');
    return count * 2; // Example: return a value based on count
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect called');
    const result = myFunction();
    // Do something with result
  }, [count]); // Dependency is now the count, not myFunction directly

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
By making `count` the dependency, the effect will run whenever `count` changes. The `myFunction` is still called, but its reference change doesn't affect the useEffect's behavior.
