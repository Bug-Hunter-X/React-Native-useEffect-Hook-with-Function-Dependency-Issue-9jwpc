# React Native useEffect Hook with Function Dependency Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Native related to using the `useEffect` hook with a function as a dependency.  Even if the function's logic remains unchanged, React Native's reconciliation process may not correctly identify changes in the function's reference, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem

When a function is included in the dependency array of `useEffect`, the effect might not trigger updates correctly if the function's reference changes, even without changes to its logic.  This can be particularly problematic when functions are created inside the component or when optimizing memoization strategies.

## Solution

The solution involves avoiding adding the function directly to the dependency array. Instead, use a value that depends on the function's results or the data the function uses.
