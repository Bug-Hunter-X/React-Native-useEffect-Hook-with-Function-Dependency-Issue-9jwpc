This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  React Native's internal reconciliation process might not correctly detect changes to the function itself, even if the function's logic remains unchanged. This leads to unexpected behavior or renders that don't update as expected. Consider this example:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const myFunction = () => {
    // Some logic
    console.log('My function called');
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect called');
    // Do something with myFunction
  }, [myFunction]); // Problem: myFunction is a dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
In this code, even if the `count` changes, the `useEffect` might not re-run if `myFunction`'s reference changes (even if its content is unchanged).
